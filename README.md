<hı> Introduction </h1>

<p> Kubernetes is an open source orchestrator for deploying containerized applications. It
was originally developed by Google, inspired by a decade of experience deploying
scalable, reliable systems in containers via application-oriented APIs </p>

There are many reasons why people come to use containers and container APIs like
Kubernetes, but we believe they can all be traced back to one of these benefits:
• Velocity
• Scaling (of both software and teams)
• Abstracting your infrastructure
• Efficiency
